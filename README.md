# travel-blog
The website is regarding travel bookings and blog management.

The website is regarding travel bookings and blog management regarding various travel destinations and tour packages. 
The blog part was created by me and it contains the following sections:  
1. Blog Creation. 
2. Blog Viewings. 
3. Delete Blog. 
4. Modify Blog.  

Also any visitor in the website can add their blogs but the only condition is that the user has to register in the website for the blog and then sign in using their credentials. Also the website provides options like forget password so that if any user forgets his/her password they can change it using their own email id which is authenticated first. 

Use WAMP or XAMP localhosts to launch this project.

Thanks!
